After analysing the set of files that were published, we decided to ignore all source data but for the contents of the *SFR05_2014_Underlying_data.zip* file, as our intention is to prepare the data for exploration witout necessarily considering the conclusions that the publisher has already drawn.

Among the contents, [*SFR05_2014_UD_metadata.txt*](data/processed/SFR05_2014_UD_metadata.txt) was then identified as their key. The file describes elements of background, coverage, data quality and statistical disclosure (anonymisation). The document also has a full explaination of the acronyms used in the data and a description of the variable names.
