##Summary

##Data
After analysing the set of files that were published, we decided to ignore all source data but for the contents of the *SFR05_2014_Underlying_data.zip* file, as our intention is to prepare the data for exploration witout necessarily considering the conclusions that the publisher has already drawn.

Among the contents, [*SFR05_2014_UD_metadata.txt*](data/processed/SFR05_2014_UD_metadata.txt) was then identified as their key. The file describes elements of the source datafiles' background, coverage, data quality and statistical disclosure (anonymisation). The document also has a full explaination of the acronyms used in the data and a description of the variable names. 

Unfortunately, the key lists the documents but does not explain what they are. Some of the files had the same name but for a "1" or "2" suffix. We started from analysing those assuming they were the same dataset split just for keeping the filesize smaller.

- SFR05_2014_UD_LA_*x*.csv: although the files appear to be similar, "1" has 24 more columns
