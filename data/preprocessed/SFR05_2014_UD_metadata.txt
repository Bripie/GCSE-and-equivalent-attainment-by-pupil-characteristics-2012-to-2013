Release of underlying data for SFR 05/2014: GCSE and Equivalent Attainment by Pupil Characteristics in England, 2012/13

Background
This statistical first release (SFR) provides 2012/13 information on attainment for GCSE and equivalent results by different pupil characteristics, specifically gender, ethnicity, eligibility for free school meals (FSM), special educational needs (SEN) and English as a first language, at National and LA level.
The 2012/13 figures contained within this SFR use data collated for the 2013 Secondary School Performance Tables, which has been checked by schools.

Coverage
This SFR covers all state-funded schools, including academies and city technology colleges.
Geographical breakdowns of figures in tables 3 to 6 are based on the local authority maintaining the school.
Figures in tables A1 to A4 are pupil residency based.
Figures in tables B1, B2 and C are school location based.

Validation and quality assurance
Key Stage 4 NPD data are created when pupils’ key stage 4 attainment records are ‘matched’ to their corresponding school census records and prior attainment records by a matching contractor, using fields such as surname, forename, date of birth, UPN and gender. This successfully matches around 60-75% of pupils.
Additional, more complex, routines are then applied to match as many of the remaining pupils as possible, up to around 97-98%.

Statistical disclosure control
To protect confidentiality the following conventions have been used throughout this publication:

•	Low counts (numbers below 3) have been suppressed and replaced by (x).  Secondary suppression has then been applied to prevent disclosure by differencing.
•	0 is shown only when the true value is 0.
•	If a denominator is 0, the associated numerator is replaced with a dot (.) as not applicable.

Least deprived - The 10 per cent of schools with the lowest proportion of all pupils at the school who are disadvantaged (eligible for FSM in any Spring Autumn, Summer, Alternative Provision or Pupil Referral Unit census from Year 6 to Year 11 or are looked after children).	

Methodology
The percentage of pupils achieving each indicator is calculated by taking the number of pupils achieving that particular indicator divided by the relevant denominator and multiplying by 100.
For example, to calculate the percentage of White girls achieving 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE or equivalent, the calculation would be as follows:

KS4_LEVEL2_girls_white_13 / NATden_girls_white_13 * 100
