GCSE and equivalent attainment by pupil characteristics: 2012 to 2013
=====================================================================

##Introduction
This is an exercise in collecting, pre-processing and cleansing an open data dataset on education made available by the UK government's Department for Education (DfE). 

Our objective is to cover the early stages - marked by the green frame - of a typical data science analysis project, as shown in the diagram below (from ["Doing Data Science"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028529.do) by Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt, O'Reilly 2013).
